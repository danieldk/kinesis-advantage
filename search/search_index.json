The default SmartSet firmware supports key remappings, macros and even some support for tap-and-hold. The SmartSet firmware has three programming interfaces: (1) on-keyboard; (2) through the SmartSet software; and (3) through text files that describe rules. The last two methods require exporing the settings through the so-called V-Drive. The V-Drive exposes the settings as a virtual drive with the FAT filesystem. The SmartSet firmware has limitations compared to popular open source firmwares like QMK . For instance, SmartSet on the KA2 only supports two layers. Some Advantage2 users replace the controller board to run open source firmware. Replacing the controller is fairly simple, since the key wells, thumb clusters, and function key rows connect to the logic board with removable ribbon cables. KinT The most popular alternative controller is the KinT . KinT and QMK support multiple Teensy microcontroller models. The project also provides Gerber files to get PCB produced. The maker of the KinT controller has made a really nice build video . If you find building a KinT to daunting, presoldered KinT controllers are often offered on eBay. KinT Blackpill Edition The KinT Blackpill Edition is a modification of the KinT that uses a Blackpill microcontroller with an USB-C connector. USB cable and alternative controllers Replacement controllers do not have a JST male plug to use the original Kinesis USB cable. I am not a 100% sure, but I think the issue is that the Teensy microcontrollers do not break out pins for the USB D+/D- wires. At any rate, people have used different solutions to this: Plug a cable in the Teensy and route it through the USB cable hole. Downsides: dust can get in, easy to damage the Teensy. Mount a USB panel to the back and plug it in the Teensy. You could even use the e-clip of the original cable with this 3D printable mount . I tried this solution, but unfortunately the e-clip would break the mount. Strip a Micro-B cable and solder a JST male connector to it . The connector type on the KB600 normally seems to be a 9 pin JST connector with 2mm pitch. Advantage: you can use the original KA2 USB cable unchanged. Disadvantages: soldering USB wires to a connector with 2mm pitch is difficult; very easy to cause shorts between wires. Strip a Micro-B cable and the original KA2 USB cable, solder the corresponding wires, and isolate (e.g. using masking tape). Disadvantage: modification of the original cable, advantage: easier to do safely.","title":"Advantage2"},{"location":"advantage2/#kinesis-advantage2","text":"","title":"Kinesis Advantage2"},{"location":"advantage2/#teardowns","text":"KB600 from left to right: SmartSet, SmartSet close-up, KinT","title":"Teardowns"},{"location":"advantage2/#controllers","text":"","title":"Controllers"},{"location":"advantage2/#smartset","text":"The default logic board with the SmartSet 4MiB firmware uses an Atmel AT32UC3B0256 microcontroller.
